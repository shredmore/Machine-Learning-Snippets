    "You may find yourself in a situation where you need/want to push a git repo that you've been working on to a different repo (i.e., a class you took had you work from the class repo and now that class is over you'd like a copy of the work you've done in a repo under your personal git user for future reference.   \n",

    "This is a straight forward process:  \n",

    "2)Add this new repo to the repo where the work has been done `git remote add name_repo repo_url`  \n",
    "3)Push the existing repo to the newly added one `git push whatever_you_put_in_name_repo_in_step_2 branch(probably master)`   \n",

    "Note: you can always check the repos \"connected\" to a project by running `git remote -v`. This will list all the remotes, including origin, that you can push and pull to/from. When you are calling `git push origin master` and `git pull origin master` 'origin' is the name of a remote."
